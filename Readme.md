## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for developing robust and scalable applications. It offers a platform-independent environment, thanks to its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. This repository aims to provide a hands-on experience with Java programming through simple and beginner-friendly examples.

## Programs

Here are some of the Java programs included in this repository:

1. [Hello World](./src/HelloWorld.java): The classic introductory program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. [Calculator](./src/Calculator.java): A basic calculator program that demonstrates arithmetic operations.

3. [Fibonacci Series](./src/Fibonacci.java): Generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified term.

## Getting Started

To run these Java programs on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-programming-repo.git`
3. Navigate to the `src` directory: `cd java-programming-repo/src`
4. Compile a program: `javac ProgramName.java` (replace `ProgramName` with the desired program's filename)
5. Run the compiled program: `java ProgramName` (without the `.java` extension)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more programs or improve existing ones, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-program`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add a new program"`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-program`
5. Open a pull request.
