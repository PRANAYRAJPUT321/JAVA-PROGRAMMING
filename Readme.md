## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used for developing robust and scalable applications. It offers a platform-independent environment, thanks to its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. This repository aims to provide a hands-on experience with Java programming through simple and beginner-friendly examples.

## Programs

Here are some of the Java programs included in this repository:

1. [Array](./All%20%20JAVA%20PROGRAMS/Array.java): The classic introductory program of Array.

2. [Array Min Max](./All%20%20JAVA%20PROGRAMS/ArrayMinMax.java): Simple program to find the Smallest  and largest Array Elements .

3. [Array Sum And Avg](./All%20%20JAVA%20PROGRAMS/ArraySumAvg.java): Simple program to Add the Array Elements and find it's Average.
  
4.  [Calculator](./All%20%20JAVA%20PROGRAMS/Calculator.java): A basic calculator program that demonstrates arithmetic operations.
  
5.  [Array Sum And Avg](./All%20%20JAVA%20PROGRAMS/Fibonacci.java): Generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified term.


## Getting Started

To run these Java programs on your machine, follow these steps:
